Another option for background opacity that is often overlooked, is using the rgba() method. Not only can the color be added but also the opacity (alpha channel) adjusted: 
.my-class {
  background-color: rgba(50,50,50,0.1);
}
In this example, I'm giving the background a dark gray color with 0.1 opacity.
